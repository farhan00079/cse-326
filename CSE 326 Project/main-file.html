        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has upended the lives of children and their families across the globe.
      UNICEF is working with experts to promote facts over fear, bringing reliable guidance to parents, 
      caregivers and educators, and partnering with front-line responders to ensure they have the 
      information and resources they need to keep children healthy and learning.</p>

      <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
        Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
         However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular 
         disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become 
         seriously ill or die at any age. 
        The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others 
        from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub
         frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.
        The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles
         range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed 
         elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.</p>
        
         <h2>Prevention</h2>

            </div>
         <h3>To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following: </h3>
         <li>Get vaccinated when a vaccine is available to you. </li>
         <li>Stay at least 1 metre apart others, even if they don’t appear to be sick.</li>
         <li>Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible or when in poorly ventilated settings</li>
            <li>Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.</li>
            <li>Wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
         <li>Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.</li>
         <li>If you feel unwell, stay home and self-isolate until you recover.</li>
